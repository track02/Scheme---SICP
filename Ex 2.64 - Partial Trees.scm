;Ex 2.64 The following procedure list->tree converts an ordered list to a balanced binary
;tree.

;The helper procedure partial-tree takes as arguments an integer n and list of at least n
;elements and constructs a balanced tree containing the first n elements of the list.
;The result returned by partial-tree is a pair (formed with cons) whose car is the constructed tree
;and whose cdris the list of elements not included in the tree

;a. Write a short paragraph explaining as clearly as you can how 
;partial-tree works. Draw the tree produced by list->tree for the list (1 3 5 7 9 11).

(define (entry tree) (car tree))
(define (left-branch tree) (cadr tree))
(define (right-branch tree) (caddr tree))
(define (make-tree entry left right)
  (list entry left right))

(define (list->tree elements)
  (car (partial-tree elements (length elements))))

(define (partial-tree elts n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (cons '() elts)
      (let ((left-size (quotient (- n 1) 2))) 
        (let ((left-result (partial-tree elts left-size))) 
          (let ((left-tree (car left-result))
                (non-left-elts (cdr left-result))
                (right-size (- n (+ left-size 1))))
            (let ((this-entry (car non-left-elts)) ;
                  (right-result (partial-tree (cdr non-left-elts)
                                              right-size)))
              (let ((right-tree (car right-result))
                    (remaining-elts (cdr right-result)))
                (cons (make-tree this-entry left-tree right-tree)
                      remaining-elts))))))))

;Partial tree works by splitting up the ordered list into left / middle (root) / right
;the left is taken as all the elements before the middle of the list (- n 1) / 2
;the middle is the root node, the center element of the list
;the right are elements after the middle of the list
;these left / right subsets of the list are recursively processed by partial-tree until
;complete partial trees are produced for each
;a final tree is assembled by joining the root to the left / right partial trees

;Trace this through with a simple list as an example e.g. (1 3 5)

;> (list->tree '(1 3 5 7 9 11))
;(5 (1 () (3 () ())) (9 (7 () ()) (11 () ())))

;                      5
;                   /    \
;                  /      \
;                 1        9
;                / \      / \
;               ()  3    7   11
;                  / \  / \  /\ 
;                 () ()() ()() ()
;

;b) What is the order of growth in the number of steps required by list->tree
; to convert a list of nelements? O(n) - each element is visited just once
